# E07a-Save-and-Load

This is an exercise for MSCH-G220 Game Technology as an intro to basic-level save/load systems that can be crafted in GODOT. Tutorial originally created by Eric Davidson, and used for educational purposes. Here is his guide to this exercise: [Basic Saving In Godot With Config Files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygGaN1EOQEA) 

This is basically just the save/load shell function meant to be a part of a game, and isn't technically a game itself. I suppose you could mentally create a game just from this, but that's alot of work.
